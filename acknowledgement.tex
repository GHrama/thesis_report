\chapter*{Acknowledgement}

Foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Dirk Helbing for giving me the opportunity to work under him. I would like to thank Dr. Evangelos Pournaras for being a pillar of support with his continuous mentoring, guidance, timely and constructive feedback through this six month period. Without him this thesis would have not being possible. In addition, I would like to thank Athina Voulgari for all her help with the pre-survey and Lewin Konneman for his help with the user interface of the mobile application.
